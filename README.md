#  CDA Ruedas Felices

**CDA Ruedas Felices** is a console-based application developed in **C# (.NET 8)**  
for managing a **Vehicle Inspection Center (CDA)**.  
It allows you to register clients, inspectors, and vehicles, and schedule mechanical inspection appointments,  
ensuring no duplicate records, validating compatibility, and maintaining a log of all emails sent.

## Main Features

- **Client Management:** Register, edit, validate by ID, and list all clients.
-  **Inspector Management:** Register, edit, and filter inspectors by inspection type.
-  **Vehicle Management:** Register vehicles per client, validate unique plates, search by plate.
-  **Appointment Management:** Schedule, cancel, complete, and validate conflicting appointments.
-  **Email System:** Simulates email notifications and keeps a full log of sent messages.
-  **Layered Architecture:** Organized into `Models`, `Data`, `Interfaces`, `Repositories`, `Services`, and `Menus`.

 Example Workflow
Scheduling an Appointment

    Register a new client.

    Register a vehicle linked to that client.

    Register an inspector with a specific inspection type.

    Navigate to Appointments → Add Appointment.

    The system validates:

        No overlapping appointments for the same vehicle or inspector.

        The inspector’s inspection type matches the vehicle type.

    Once valid, the appointment is saved and a confirmation email (simulated) is sent.

 Email System

The system uses a simulated email sender (EmailSender) that displays sent messages in the console.
All email logs are stored in memory (Database.EmailLogs)
and can be viewed through:

Main Menu → Option 5 (Email Log)
